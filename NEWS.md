* `debian_add_swap` adds swap memory, but was not persisted across
reboots. fixed now (#127) thanks @trestletech

`tag_delete()`, `tag_rename()`, `tag_resource()`,
`tag_resource_delete()`, `tags()`, and `as.tag()` (#117)
* Related to last bulllet: `droplet_delete()` gains new parameter `tag`;
`droplets()` gains new parameter `tag`, and examples added to its man file
for tag usage.

* Improved description of `name` parameter for `droplet_create()` and
`docklet_create()`

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed problem with `docklet_create()` when port 22 is not open
before further action is taken on the droplet. We now check if
port 22 is open and error with informative message about waiting
a bit for it to open (#113) thanks @fmichonneau @hrbrmstr
* Fixed problem in the `print.droplet` due to problem in `droplet_ip()` internal function (#109)
* Fix to `*_create` to allow flexibility in how often DO API is pinged.
Previously we pinged every second, meaning you could hit your API rate limit
fastish. Now you can set an option `do.wait_time` to tweak time
bewtween pings to check for droplet creation (or other actions).
for example of doing droplet creation in parallel. (#108) thanks @simecek !
* Fixed parsing bug in `sizes()` (#119)

analogsea 0.3.0

### NEW FEATURES

* Released to CRAN.
